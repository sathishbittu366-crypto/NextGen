# Analysis_JAN-2026 col 57-59. These are NOT a malformed 10th subject
# block; the wide-block loop must recognize and skip them via this spec
# set rather than walking into them with its 6-column stride.

# real file: 3+3+4+3+3+1.5+1.5+1+0 = 20, matching the trailing column
# exactly) so it is recognized/reported but never written anywhere new;
# the batch total is always derivable via SUM(result_items.credits).
# "backlogs" has no existing result_items column and adding one is a new
# schema decision outside this workstream's approved scope (§2.5 approved
# exactly three columns) — recognized so it is reported as mapped, not
