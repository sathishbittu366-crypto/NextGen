"""Token-based auth — OPTION_B_REWRITE_PLAN.md §3.3, Option 3a (confirmed
by Boss over 3b): httpOnly refresh cookie carries the long-lived
credential; the SPA holds a short-lived access token in memory (never
localStorage — this app handles Aadhaar numbers, see §3.3's reasoning).

Two tokens, two lifetimes:
  - access token:  15 min,  returned in the JSON body, held in a JS
                    variable by the frontend, sent as `Authorization: Bearer`.
  - refresh token: 7 days (matches old SESSION_MAX_AGE), httpOnly+secure
                    cookie, never touched by JS, used only to mint a new
                    access token via POST /api/auth/refresh.

Both are itsdangerous signed payloads (same primitive as the old
webapp/auth_session.py, same SECRET_KEY) — not a parallel crypto scheme,
just two serializers with different salts/max_ages instead of one cookie.

— must_change_password (plan §3.3: "stays a first-class part of whatever
the token/session payload is")
WHY it's in BOTH tokens, not just the refresh token: get_current_user()
below only ever decodes the access token (the refresh token is opaque to
every route except /api/auth/refresh), so if the flag lived only in the
refresh token, a flagged user's access token would silently omit it and
every route's gate would fail open. Re-embedding it on every refresh
(see refresh_access_token()) keeps it correct even if the DB flag
changes between refreshes (e.g. a HOD manually resets someone's account).
